    <p>My favorite city in ethiopia, is Bahir Dar city. this picture. Bahir Dar is a clean and well-maintained city by African city standards. It is popular with national tourists for its lake and comfortable climate.
      It has become part of the northern tourist loop for its access to historic monasteries and as a jumping off point for Blue Nile Falls and Gondar. Due to the bustling tourism industry, the city has numerous pool halls, bars, fresh juice shops, and restaurants.
      Giorgis Road is the main road in the north-south direction, featuring plenty of shopping and restaurants. The bus station and markets lie on side roads. The city is easy to get around by foot, bicycle, or cheap bajaj (tuk tuk).</p>
